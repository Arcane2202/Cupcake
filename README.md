# Cupcake
 A simple social site
Cupcake. It is basically a social media platform. Here by the term social media, we 
are meaning that a platform where people can connect from all over the world and 
can be connected virtually by sharing texts and images. There are so many social 
media platforms available right now, like, Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp, Telegram 
etc. We have tried to make one like them. For designing the front end, we used 
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and for the backend, we used PHP, JavaScript and MySQL 
database server.
